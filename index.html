        <h1>Goodbye Hoyle Family!</h1>
        <p>Hi Lucy and Emily! Thank you for letting us elves crash at your house this Christmas. If we’d stayed in the workshop, we’d be buried in glitter and wrapping paper! It’s way more fun hanging out with you.</p>
        <p>Guess what? Santa’s coming to pick us up tonight! He says his sleigh is too squishy on Christmas Eve for all the elves, so we get a bonus day to watch you play with your new presents. We might even try out a few ourselves (don’t tell Santa!).</p>
        <p>Oh, and please tell your Dad we’re super-duper sorry about his chocolates. We thought they were elf snacks! Next year, we’ll bring him some magical North Pole treats—promise!</p>
        <p>
            Your hot chocolate was super yummy! We tried SO hard not to spill it, but oops—elves are a bit clumsy. Santa’s hot chocolate is extra magical—he adds sparkly sprinkles that make your tummy giggle!
        </p>
