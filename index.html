        <h1>Goodbye Hoyle Family!</h1>
        <p>
          Hi Lucy and Emily! Thank you for letting us elves crash at your house
          this Christmas. If we’d stayed in the workshop, we’d be buried in
          glitter and wrapping paper! It’s way more fun hanging out with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guess what? Santa’s coming to pick us up really soon! His sleigh is
          super magical and can fit all the elves from around the world (and
          even more presents!). We’re going to miss you both SO much, but we’re
          also really excited to see Santa and tell him all about our adventures
          with you!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and please tell your Dad we’re super-duper sorry about his
          chocolates. We thought they were elf snacks! Next year, we’ll bring
          him some magical North Pole treats—promise!
        </p>
        <p>
          Your hot chocolate was super yummy! We tried SO hard not to spill it,
          but oops—elves are a bit clumsy. Santa’s hot chocolate is extra
          magical—he adds sparkly sprinkles that make your tummy giggle!
        </p>
        <p>
          We had a blast hanging out with your friends! Barbie is always ready
          for an elf dance party—she even let us have a go on her slide. But
          those gnomes? Yikes! They’re a little sneaky, so we had to trap one
          under a Christmas present just to make sure it didn’t escape and start
          a food fight in your room!
        </p>
        <p>
          Your mum and dad are awesome—they built us the coolest Lego house ever! We tried
          to squeeze in, but elves are a bit bigger than Lego people (even
          bigger than Kevin!). We loved our little home, though. Thank you for
          sharing it with us!
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we go, we wanted to make you something super special! We used
          all your Christmas cards to build a magical Christmas tree just for
          you. We hope you loved seeing it! We were a bit surprised when it fell
          over—was that you, Lucy, or maybe a sneaky elf tumble? Either way, it
          made us giggle!
        </p>
        <p>
          We knew Santa would be picking us up soon to fly back to the North
          Pole, so we wanted to get a super good night’s sleep! Thank you for
          leaving out a cozy sleeping bag for us—it was perfect for two tired
          elves. Your play room was a little messy (just like the elf
          workshop!), but that made us feel right at home. When we get back, all
          the elves have a huge Christmas Eve party with music, dancing, and
          lots of giggles. We can’t wait to tell everyone about our adventures
          with you!
        </p>
        <p>
          We really hope we can visit again next year! But who knows, maybe it
          will be some of our friends.
        </p>
        <p>Lots of love from your favourite elves!</p>
        <p>Elvis and Christine</p>
        <p>xoxoxo</p>
